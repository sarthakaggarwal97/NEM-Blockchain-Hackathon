Project specs: http://bob.nem.ninja/docs/

* project Major version and Minor version can be set in /app/version.properties manually.
 Build/production build versions are managed automatically by build system, there's no need to edit them.

    If in original specs it has ViewModel suffix, it's omitted, e.g. KeyPairViewModel => KeyPairApiDto;
* account salt is not used for generating passwords.
